## Supabase and Admin panel setup

Follow these steps to connect Supabase and enable the Admin panel:

1. Create a Supabase project at https://app.supabase.com/
2. In Project Settings → API copy the Project URL and anon (public) key.
3. Create a `.env` or `.env.local` file in the project root with:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
# comma separated admin emails (lowercase)
VITE_ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@example.com,other@domain.com
```

4. In Supabase → Table Editor → select your `products` table → Policies. Add a policy to allow select for public (or for auth users):

```sql
create policy "Allow public select"
on "public"."products"
as permissive
for select
to public
using (true);
```

5. For production, do NOT set `to public` — instead create policies that check `auth.role()` or user metadata and restrict by `VITE_ADMIN_EMAILS` in your app.

6. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

7. Visit `/admin/login` to sign in using the magic link you configured in Supabase Auth. Make sure the sign-in email is included in `VITE_ADMIN_EMAILS`.

Notes:
- The AdminRoute component checks `VITE_ADMIN_EMAILS` to determine whether the logged-in user is allowed.
- Improve authorization by adding an `is_admin` flag in a database table or using Supabase user metadata.
